# BlackList

*"You've disappointed me for the last time." - Wise raid leader*

Enhanced for Turtle WoW (Classic 1.12)

BlackList is a World of Warcraft addon that adds a comprehensive player management system to your Friends Tab on the Social Panel. Unlike the built-in Ignore system which has limits, BlackList lets you track unlimited players with detailed information, custom reasons, and flexible warning options.

## What it does

BlackList adds a new "BlackList" tab to your Friends frame, similar to the Friends and Ignore tabs. You can add players with detailed information including their level, class, race, faction, and a custom reason for blacklisting them. The addon can warn you with text and sound when you interact with blacklisted players, and optionally block communication or party invites from them.

The addon now includes a comprehensive options menu where you can control exactly how BlackList behaves. You can choose to block whispers, prevent party invitations, get warnings when targeting players, and much more.

## How to use it

Adding someone to your BlackList is easy:

- Target a player and type /blacklist or /bl in chat
- Use the "BlackList Player" button in the BlackList tab
- Type /blacklist PlayerName to add someone by name
- Add a reason with /blacklist PlayerName They ninja looted my item

You can also use /removeblacklist or /removebl to remove players from your list.

When you have someone targeted, BlackList will automatically fill in their details like level, class, and race. You can edit this information later by clicking on their name in the list to open the details window.

## Options and features

Click the "Options" button in the BlackList tab to access detailed settings:

**General Settings:**
- Play warning sounds - controls whether you hear audio alerts
- Warn when targeting - shows messages when you target blacklisted players

**Communication:**
- Prevent whispers from blacklisted players (they get an auto-ignore response)
- Warn when blacklisted players whisper you

**Group Management:**
- Prevent blacklisted players from inviting you to groups
- Prevent yourself from accidentally inviting blacklisted players
- Warn when blacklisted players join your party or raid

## Why use BlackList?

For players on your faction, you might blacklist ninja looters, people who leave groups without warning, scammers, or just players you don't want to group with again. For opposite faction players, you might track gankers, campers, or griefers who target you repeatedly.

BlackList is better than the built-in Ignore system because it has no limit on how many players you can add, lets you store detailed information about why you blacklisted someone, and gives you flexible control over how warnings and blocking work.

## pfUI Integration

BlackList now automatically integrates with pfUI when that addon is active! If you're using pfUI to enhance your Classic WoW interface, BlackList will detect it and style all its frames (options menu, details window, etc.) to match pfUI's modern look and feel.

When pfUI is not present, BlackList falls back to standard Classic WoW styling, so it works perfectly either way.

## Installation

The addon saves all your data between game sessions and keeps separate lists for each character and realm. It's lightweight and won't interfere with other addons.

BlackList has been updated and enhanced for the Turtle WoW community with modern options and improved functionality while maintaining compatibility with Classic WoW.
